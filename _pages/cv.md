Professional experience
======
* 08/2025-present: Postdoctoral Associate (Supervisor: Manolis Kellis)
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
* Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)
  * Apply advanced machine learning methods to integrate and analyze transcriptomic and multiomic datasets in the context of HIV with substance use disorder and Alzheimer’s disease with pathogen infection.
  * Develop computational pipelines for large-scale single cell multiomic analysis to identify molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
  * Discover candidate biomarkers and regulatory networks linking pathogen infection, substance use, and neurodegenerative processes.
  * Collaborate in cross-disciplinary teams, contributing computational expertise to biological interpretation and manuscript preparation.

* 07/2023-08/2025: Graduate Research Assistant (Supervisor: Fox Howard)
* University of Nebraska Medical Center
* Neurological Sceince
  * Identified and characterized microglia, macrophage, and lymphocyte phenotypes during acute and chronic SIV infection, revealing subsets associated with HIV/SIV-related neurological disorders.
  * Revealed transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms of brain myeloid cell susceptibility using scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, including host transcription factors and potential viral integration sites.
  * Characterized lymphoid–myeloid interactions in the CNS and demonstrated efferocytosis dynamics through integration of computational and experimental validation.
  * Discovered combined effects of chronic SIV infection, cART, and opioids on brain myeloid cells, and identified candidate biomarkers for cART-treated infection.

08/2021-07/2023: Graduate Research Assistant (Supervisor: Dong Wang)
* University of Nebraska Medical Center
* Pharmaceutical Science
  * Developed and characterized a thermoresponsive polymeric simvastatin prodrug for experimental periodontitis treatment.
  * Conducted in vitro release and structural analyses using MS, NMR, HPLC, DLS, SAXS, and GPC-MALS.
  * Established a rat periodontitis model and evaluated toxicity and efficacy via Micro-CT, blood analysis, and immunostaining.

* 08/2020-06/2021: Research Assistant
  * Innostellar Bio Co., Ltd, Shanghai
    * Contributed to R&D on gene therapy (AAV-based) development, verification, and preclinical studies.
    * Assisted in developing two gene therapies targeting Leber congenital amaurosis 2 (LCA2) and macular degeneration.
    * Performed molecular cloning, DNA/RNA extraction, qPCR-based virus titer testing, AAV purification, and preclinical evaluations including ERG, OCT, and histology in mice.
